# <NotOrBIOS_> Roast
<NotOrBIOS_> Roast is a single page aplication [we](#team) built for our <Junior Full Stack Developer> bootcamp last summarizer.

After 14 weeks in <NotOrBIOS_> class, there was no better way to end it :)

Roaster and Roastee are determined in random way and no one can be Roaster or Roastee more than one time.

That was our way to laugh off that last day and there was no one better to Roast us than ourselves.
